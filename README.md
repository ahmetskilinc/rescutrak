# Animal Rescue Tracking Web App

## What It Is:

This is a small project a friend of mine had the idea of creating. After creating it in PHP and not enjoying it I decided to take it upon myself to create it in React using Firebase for the backend. Some screenshots are below.

## What I Used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
